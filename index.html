      <section class="about">
        <p>Hi! I am <strong>Badri Bishal Das</strong>, a Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Undergraduate at Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IIT Guwahati), Guwahati, India. I'm primarily interested in systems and low-level engineering, algorithms, and mathematical problem solving. I am open to any opportunity for Winter 2025 & Summer 2026. Feel free to approach me through the email given.</p>
        
        <h3>Interests & Focus Areas</h3>
        
        <h4>Systems, Performance & Low-Level Engineering</h4>
        <p>I am deeply interested in understanding how software actually works beneath the abstractions. This includes computer architecture, operating systems, and low-level performance behavior. I enjoy exploring topics like memory models, threading, race conditions, synchronization, cache behavior, and scheduling, and how these influence real-world system performance.</p>
        
        <p>I have a strong interest in modern C++, particularly areas such as template metaprogramming, compile-time techniques, performance-oriented design, and writing predictable, efficient code. I like studying how compilers transform code and how small implementation choices can have significant performance implications.</p>
        
        <h4>Algorithms, Mathematics & Problem Solving</h4>
        <p>I am strongly drawn to algorithmic thinking and mathematical problem solving. I enjoy working on topics such as algorithms and data structures, game theory and strategic reasoning, probability and combinatorics, advanced dynamic programming patterns, invariants and constructive techniques, and quantitative logic puzzles.</p>
        
        <p>Competitive programming is especially appealing to me because it sits at the intersection of theory, implementation, and performance under constraints.</p>
        
        <h4>Quantitative Thinking & Puzzles</h4>
        <p>I am fascinated by quantitative reasoning, especially problems that require deep insight rather than formulaic approaches. I enjoy solving quant puzzles, logical riddles, and problems that demand careful modeling and precise reasoning.</p>
        
        <h3>Outside of Tech</h3>
        <p>Outside academics, I enjoy staying physically active. I regularly play badminton, go running, and follow fitness as a way to stay disciplined and mentally sharp. I also enjoy listening to music and exploring new ideas across domains.</p>
